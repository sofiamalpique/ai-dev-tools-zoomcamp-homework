Prompt used to kick off the build (Q1):

```
Build a full-stack collaborative coding interview app. Requirements: create shareable session links, real-time collaborative editing on one code panel, syntax highlighting for JavaScript + Python, client-only code execution (JS sandboxed iframe + Python via Pyodide), and simple API health/session creation. Stack: React + Vite frontend, Express backend with a WebSocket endpoint for room-based code sync, CodeMirror editor, npm workspaces, Node 20. Add integration tests (Playwright) for collaboration and run output. Provide npm scripts for dev/build/test, and a README with run/test/build instructions.
```
